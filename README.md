# qccs211
All projects from CS211 from Dr. Waxman. If you are a current CS211 student, do not copy any of the code.

#Project 2: 
Write a program that simulates a digital odometer. It has 6 “windows” and will output the miles as you travel, starting at 000000 and ending at 999999 (after which you probably want to sell the car anyway …).
